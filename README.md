# Digital-System-Design-using-Verilog
To impart the concepts of Verilog HDL-data flow and behavioural models for the design of digital systems in Programs.
1) To simplify the given Boolean expressions and realize using Verilog program
2)To realize Adder/Subtractor(Full/half)circuits using Verilog data flow description.
3) To realize 4-bit ALU using Verilog program.
4) To realize the following Code converters using Verilog Behavioral description
  a)Gray to binary and vice versa b)Binary to excess3 and vice versa
5) To realize using Verilog Behavioral description:8:1mux, 8:3encoder, Priority encoder
6) To realize using Verilog Behavioral description:1:8Demux, 3:8 decoder,2 –bit Comparator
7) To realize using Verilog Behavioral description:
  Flip-flops: a)JK type b)SR type c)T type and d)D type
8) To realize Counters-up/down (BCD and binary)using Verilog Behavioral description. 
9) Verilog Program to interface a Stepper motor to the FPGA/CPLD and rotate the motor
   in the specified direction (by N steps).
10) Verilog programs to interface Switches and LEDs to the FPGA/CPLD and demonstrate
   its working. 
#Course outcomes (Course Skill Set):At the end of this we will be able to:
1) Simplify Boolean functions using K-map and Quine-McCluskey minimization technique.
2) Analyze and design for combinational logic circuits.
3) Analyze the concepts of Flip Flops(SR, D,T and JK) and to design the synchronous sequential
circuits using Flip Flops.
4) Model Combinational circuits (adders, subtractors, multiplexers) and sequential circuits using
Verilog descriptions.
